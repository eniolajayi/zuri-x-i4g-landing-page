# zuri-x-i4g-landing-page
Landing Page for Zuri.ng - a project at the zuri.ng Internship.
Built this website while I was an Intern at Zuri.ng. 
The design was created by the talented and awesome UI/UX designers on my team. 
I was tasked with buidling the design with a tight 48hour deadline. finished the task with more time to spare.
This project was very helpful and really helped build up my team communicaton skills, how to work closely with a UI/UX designer and proper time management.
